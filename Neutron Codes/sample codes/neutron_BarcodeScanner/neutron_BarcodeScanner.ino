  Begin scanning for barcodes

  This example demonstrates how to get the scanner connected and will output any barcode it sees.

  NOTE: You must put the module into TTL mode by scanning the POR232. barcode in the datasheet.
  This will put the module in the correct mode to receive and transmit serial. The baud rate in POR232
  defaults to 115200 which is too fast for software serial. This library will automatically set the baud rate to 9600bps.

  To connect the barcode scanner to an Arduino:

  (Arduino pin) = (Scanner pin)
  2 = TX pin on scanner
  3 = RX pin on scanner
  GND = GND
  3.3V = 3.3V

char scanBuffer[BUFFER_LEN];

void setup()
{ 
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Serial.println("DE2120 Scanner Example");

  if (scanner.begin(softSerial) == false)
  {
    Serial.println("Scanner did not respond. Please check wiring. Did you scan the POR232 barcode? Freezing...");
    while (1)
      ;
  }
  Serial.println("Scanner online!");
}

void loop()
{
  if (scanner.readBarcode(scanBuffer, BUFFER_LEN))
  {
    Serial.print("Code found: ");
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(scanBuffer); i++)
      Serial.print(scanBuffer[i]);
    Serial.println();
  }

  delay(200);
